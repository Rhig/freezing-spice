Freezing Spice
--------------
A pipelined (5-stage) RISC-V implementation, written in VHDL.  It is targeted for FPGA synthesis.

Status
------
While not yet finished, a large part of the RV32-I instruction set is implemented.  

Implementation
--------------
+ VHDL - RTL
+ Simulation - GHDL / GtkWave

TODO
----
+ CSRs (Core Specific Registers)
+ Interrupts / Exceptions
+ Probably more...
